# Twitter-sentiment-analysis

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a unique subset of Machine Learning which cares about the real life unstructured data. Although computers cannot identify and process the string inputs, the libraries like NLTK, TextBlob and many others found a way to process string mathematically. Twitter is a platform where most of the people express their feelings towards the current context. As humans, we can guess the sentiment of a sentence whether it is positive or negative.

Similarly, in this article Iâ€™m going to show you how to train and develop a simple Twitter Sentiment Analysis supervised learning model using python and NLP libraries.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
